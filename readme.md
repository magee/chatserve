ChatServe
=========================

A chat server application written as a project at Hack Reactor.  I worked on this project independently (we had an odd number of students so one worked alone each sprint) but used chat client code (index.html, styles.css) developed with a partner, Carl Lumma, for an earlier project where we coded a client against an automated chat generator back end.

Project:  write a chat server which receives chat inputs from a web client and outputs them to the window.  Allow users to create new chat rooms.

Tests were authored by Hack Reactor staff.

Status
-----------------
Project is a work-in-progress.  Chats are received and written successfully to an external chat log file by the server. Remaining tasks: write chats to screen, add new room functionality.
